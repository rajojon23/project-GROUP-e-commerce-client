# project-GROUP-e-commerce-client
Client version only of [project-GROUP-e-commerce] (https://github.com/cb-wd-5/project-GROUP-e-commerce)

We have to make use of stacks that we have learned thus far in the bootcamp to build an e-commerce app that will showcase all of the provided _wearables_ items.

The stack is React.Js, Redux, Node.Js, and styled-components.

The node server should be RESTful and follow REST principles.

**âœ‹ We CANNOT use any external UI libraries, including, but not limited to, Material UI, Bootstrap.**

## How to run locally
1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start`
3. The application should automatically open up in your browser, if not you can access at `http://localhost:3000/`
